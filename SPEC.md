# Clew v1 — Spec

*A clew is the ball of thread Ariadne gave Theseus to find his way through the
labyrinth. Clew is a thread through your day: what's left, what's done.*

Status: draft, 2026-11-08. Not started.

## The problem

Many goals (courses, videos and articles, job applications, exercise), but plans
don't hold. Reminders failed before because they were **inconvenient and not
interesting**. Long backlogs feel overwhelming, so nothing gets finished.

What works: **seeing the list**. Something left to do is the warning. Everything
done means a good day. Visible progress ("10 of 30") makes finishing satisfying.

```

## In scope

1. **Menu bar list.** A SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra`. The title shows `done/total` for today.
   Click it to open today's list. No main window is required.
2. **Item kinds.**
   - *Once*: done on a chosen day; if not done, it quietly moves to tomorrow.
     Saved links in the Later pile behave the same once picked for a day.
   - *Repeating*: daily, chosen weekdays, or N times per week. Once a weekly
     target is met, the item leaves Today's list until next Monday, unless you
     ticked it today.
   - *Counted goal*: a total (e.g. 30 videos). One click is `+1`; click again
     to log more. The bar shows lifetime progress; the item counts as done today
     once you've added at least one.
3. **Links.** Any item can have a URL. `↗` opens it in the default browser.
4. **Done in one click.** Click `○` to mark it done (counted goals: +1). Three small
   rating dots then appear **inside the same row** every time. The row never changes
   height and the dots never cover the `+1` target, so rapid ticks can't mis-click.
   Optional; they fade after a few seconds. Ticked items stay visible until the day
   rolls over, so undo is always one click away.
5. **Later pile.** Saving a link (paste into `+ add`, or choose "Later") puts it
   in a hidden pile. Its count is shown, its contents aren't. "Pick 1–3 for today"
   moves items onto the list. Items untouched for 6 weeks get a one-tap
   "still want this?". Saying no counts as a win.
6. **Gentle reminders** (optional, per item, off by default). One notification at
   a chosen time with **Open / Done / Later** actions. No repeats, no escalation.
7. **Day summaries** (each optional): morning "6 today" at 9:00, evening "5/6 done"
   at 21:00, both changeable. Short, friendly, never a list of failures. A day
   with no ticks gets an encouraging line instead of "0/6".
8. **Local data.** A SQLite database (GRDB) in Application Support. One-click JSON
   export. No account, no network.
9. **Launch at login** (`SMAppService`), toggled in a small Settings window.

## Design rules (from ADHD/CBT practice)

- **Point of performance** (Barkley): the list is always one glance away, in the menu bar.
- **Chunk big goals** (Safren, CBT for adult ADHD): every long goal becomes
  a visible count of small steps.
- **Distractibility delay** (Safren): a new idea goes to Later in one action,
  so it doesn't derail the current task.
- **No shame.** No red, no streaks, no "missed" counters. Unfinished items roll
  forward silently. Celebrate what got done.
- **Minimal text.** Labels and numbers. No paragraphs, no chatty coaching.
- **Tone:** a friend. Encouraging, never pushy.

## Out of scope for v1 (planned later)

- **Daruma goals and badges.** Paint one eye when a counted goal starts and the
  second when it's finished. Levels come from lifetime totals.
- Browser extension import: YouTube Watch Later (list + watch %, verified feasible
  2026-11-08) and X bookmarks.
- Opt-in AI coach: recap, Later suggestions, quick start (see docs/AGENT.md).
- Sync with Dayflow (its local JSON API: `GET /api/day`, `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`).
- iPhone, iCloud sync, Obsidian export.

## Done means used

v1 is done when it has been **used on 5 of 7 days for two weeks**, not when its
tests pass. Clew records active days locally (a day with at least one tick) and
shows them only in Settings. Until that bar is met, the next work is fixing whatever
stopped daily use, not adding features.

## Decisions (2026-11-08)

- Weeks start on **Monday**; "N× per week" items reset then.
- A counted goal's step is always **+1** per click.
- The rating row is offered **every time**, and is always skippable.
- The menu bar title is an icon plus `done/total`, not the word "Clew" (2026-11-08, v1a).
- A counted goal's undo is a small `−` beside its count, shown only after a `+1` today;
  it removes the last `+1`. It sits apart from the circle so rapid ticks can't hit it
  (2026-11-08, v1a).
- Summary defaults: **9:00** and **21:00**, off until switched on.

## Open question

1. Which global hotkey, if any, opens the list? (v1 can ship without one.)

## Tech

Swift 6, SwiftUI, macOS 14+, XcodeGen (`project.yml`), GRDB. Unit tests in a
framework target so they run without launching the app. Copy
`install-local.sh` and `LoginItem.swift` from Tact, minus its Accessibility
signing step. App Sandbox stays **on**: Clew needs no Accessibility permission.
